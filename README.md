# Employee Management
*This is a simple Winforms project that manages employees' (or any group of people) info

*Data includes name, address, phone number, email, and a photo (Yes, you can take your picture!)

*It was originally built as a coding challenge and for an Azure SQL Server Database - although it should work for any db with minimal changes

*Technologies used include Entity Framework, multithreading, Async/Await, LINQ, and more!
